This approach is used to improve tasks such as answering questions, generating long texts, and interacting with large databases.

# Characteristics
Information Search: Integrates modules to search for relevant information in a database or corpus.
Text Generation: Uses advanced text generation models to produce coherent responses.
Customizable: Easy to adjust to different domains and applications.
Scalability: Supports large volumes of data and simultaneous queries.
